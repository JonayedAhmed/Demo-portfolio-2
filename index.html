                    hard and learn many things like React and Node Js. So  
                    I am excited to learn them.

                This is my secord demo portfolio website. I want to continue this development 
                and want to utilizie the best of 2022 through practicing. Since this is just a 
                demo so buttons are not functionable. I will improve and add functionalities to these
                buttons. Other that HTML and CSS I want to develop websites based on React Js and 
                as a backend I want to learn Node Js. I am also learning them and completing projects
                to start my career as a full stack web developer as soon as possible.

                I am CSE graduate. I have worked with HTML and CSS before. But I am 
                more interested in programming. My favourity programming languages are 
                Java, Python and JS. I have multiple projects using JavaFx, Pyhton. I havent 
                done any major project using JS as I am new to JS. But Hopefully I will create one.
